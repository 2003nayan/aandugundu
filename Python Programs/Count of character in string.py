str1 = '''Yes, tuples are included in the topic of data structures.

In computer science and programming, data structures are a way to organize and store data in a particular format. They provide efficient ways to access, manipulate, and manage data.

A tuple is a built-in data structure in Python that represents an ordered, immutable sequence of elements. It is similar to a list but has a few key differences. Tuples are defined using parentheses () and elements are separated by commas. For example: (1, 2, 3).

Tuples are immutable, which means once they are created, their elements cannot be modified. However, you can access elements using indexing and perform operations such as slicing and unpacking.'''
